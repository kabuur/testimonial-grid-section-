                                     I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard 
                                     some people who had an amazing experience here.
                                      I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. 
                                    Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                        <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                             I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn 
                             programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                             student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. 
                             The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                              hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                               project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                                next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, 
                                I’ve often referred to it during interviews as
                             an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land 
                             a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
